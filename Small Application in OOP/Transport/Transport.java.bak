/*
1. Class: Vehicle (Superclass)
Data Members:
String model – Vehicle model
String registrationNumber – Registration number of the vehicle
double speed – Vehicle speed in kilometers per hour
double fuelCapacity – Fuel tank capacity in liters
double fuelConsumption – Fuel consumption in kilometers per liter
Member Methods:
Parameterized Constructor
Initializes all data members with the given values.
Getters and Setters
Provide get and set methods for each data member.
fuelNeeded(double distance)
Accepts distance (in kilometers) as an argument.
Calculates and returns the amount of fuel required for that distance.
distanceCovered(double time)
Accepts time (in hours) as an argument.
Calculates and returns the distance covered based on the vehicle’s speed.
display()
Displays all details of the vehicle, including model, registration number, speed, fuel capacity, and fuel consumption.

2. Class: Truck (Subclass of Vehicle)
Additional Data Member:
double cargoWeightLimit – Cargo carrying capacity in kilograms.
Member Methods:
Parameterized Constructor
Initializes all data members, including those inherited from the Vehicle class (using super()), and cargoWeightLimit.
Overridden display() Method
Must call super.display() to display the base class details, and then display the cargo weight limit specific to the truck.
 
 
3. Class: Bus (Subclass of Vehicle)
Additional Data Member:
int numberOfPassengers – Total number of passengers the bus can carry.
Member Methods:
Parameterized Constructor
Initializes all data members, including those from the superclass (using super()).
Getters and Setters
Provide getter and setter methods for numberOfPassengers.
Overridden display() Method
Must call super.display() to display base class details, and then display the number of passengers specific to the bus.
 
 
4. Class: Transport (Driver Class)
Description:
 This class must contain the main() method to test inheritance and method overriding.
Steps to Perform in main() Method:
Create an object of Truck and initialize all its data members with valid values using the parameterized constructor.
Create an object of Bus and initialize all its data members with valid values using the parameterized constructor.
For both objects:
Call the fuelNeeded() method by passing a sample distance (e.g., 500 km).
Call the distanceCovered() method by passing a sample time (e.g., 5 hours).
Call the display() method to display all details.
Concepts Demonstrated:
Inheritance (Superclass → Subclasses)
Constructor Chaining using super()
Method Overriding (display() method)
Encapsulation (Private data members with getters/setters)
Polymorphism (Different display() methods for Bus and Truck)
